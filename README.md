-Listen to your music
-Create your own lightshow
-All in a virtual environment


DJ-Light-Show allows someone to interact in real time with music while also enjoying it and feeling like they are part 
of playing the music. This project will introduce a VR scenario for listening to music and enjoying your favorite set from 
your favorite DJ in a new way. Currently during the pandemic, nobody is able to go to shows anymore and that is something 
that many of us miss. Listening to music is one thing but being in an environment dedicated to music allows people to 
experience it on a whole different level.
